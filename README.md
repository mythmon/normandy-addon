# Development

To install requirements:

```bash
$ npm install
```

# Normandy

The preference `extensions.recipeclient.api_url` is read to contact a Normandy
server. There is no default yet. It should be set to something like
`https://localhost:8443/api/v1/`.

The easiest way to run a Normandy server locally is using [normandy-compose][].
